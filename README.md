# Welcome to My Cloud Engineering Knowledge Base

## About This Resource

Welcome to my comprehensive knowledge repository on modern cloud architecture, DevOps practices, and platform engineering. With over 28 years of experience working across AWS, Azure, GCP, and NixOS environments, I've compiled this resource to document best practices, technical insights, and practical solutions that have proven effective throughout my career.

As a Cloud Architect and DevOps Leader, I'm passionate about building resilient, secure, and efficient cloud systems while constantly exploring emerging technologies and methodologies. Whether you're a seasoned cloud professional or just beginning your journey, I hope you'll find valuable information to enhance your understanding and implementation of cloud-native approaches.

## Multi-Cloud & Modern DevOps in 2025

In today's rapidly evolving landscape, successful cloud engineering encompasses several key areas:

### 1. Cloud-Native Architecture

Modern cloud solutions leverage containerization (Kubernetes), serverless computing, and microservices architectures to create scalable, resilient systems that can span multiple cloud providers while maintaining consistent governance and security controls.

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & GitOps

Beyond just automation, today's cloud environments are fully defined and managed through code (Terraform, Bicep, Crossplane), with infrastructure changes flowing through the same robust testing and validation processes as application code. GitOps practices ensure infrastructure state matches its declared configuration in Git.

### 3. Platform Engineering & Developer Experience

Creating internal developer platforms with self-service capabilities accelerates innovation while maintaining governance. Tools like Backstage, custom Kubernetes operators, and service meshes build a cohesive ecosystem that empowers developers while preserving operational stability.

### 4. Observability & Reliability Engineering

Advanced monitoring goes beyond metrics to include distributed tracing, sophisticated logging, and chaos engineering practices that proactively identify and mitigate potential system failures before they impact users.

### 5. DevSecOps & Compliance Automation

Security is embedded throughout the development lifecycle with automated vulnerability scanning, supply chain security controls, and compliance verification - shifting security left while maintaining velocity.

## About Me

I'm a London-based Cloud Architect and DevOps leader with extensive experience designing and implementing enterprise-scale cloud solutions across AWS, Azure, and GCP. My expertise spans Kubernetes orchestration, NixOS/Nix-based immutable infrastructure, GitOps workflows, and multi-cloud governance models.

Currently working as a Senior DevOps Consultant specializing in helping organizations implement modern cloud-native practices. Previously held leadership positions at R3, Contino, Live-Tech Games, Kantar, OFGEM, and other technology organizations.

Feel free to explore this knowledge base, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
