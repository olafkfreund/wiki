# Azure Databricks (2025 Update)

Azure Databricks is a fast, easy, and collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for Microsoft Azure. It provides:

- **One-click setup** and streamlined workflows for big data analytics and AI/ML workloads.
- **Deep integration with Azure** services (Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Key Vault, etc.).
- **Enterprise-grade security** with support for private endpoints, managed virtual networks, secure cluster connectivity (no public IP), and fine-grained access control.
- **Scalable and automated infrastructure** for data engineering, data science, and analytics teams.

## Key Features (2025)
- **Workspace Deployment**: Use Bicep or Terraform to deploy workspaces with private endpoints, custom VNETs, and managed resource groups. Disable public network access for enhanced security.
- **Cluster Management**: Create clusters with autoscaling, secure networking, and Unity Catalog integration for data governance.
- **Network Security**: Leverage NSGs, private endpoints, and Azure Private Link to restrict access. Always prefer disabling public IPs for clusters and workspaces.
- **Access Control**: Integrate with Azure Active Directory for RBAC and use Azure Key Vault for secret management.
- **Compliance**: Supports compliance with major standards (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO, etc.) when deployed with recommended security configurations.

## Best Practices
- Always deploy workspaces in a custom VNET with private endpoints and public network access disabled.
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Bicep, Terraform) for repeatable, auditable deployments.
- Apply NSGs to all subnets and restrict inbound/outbound traffic to only what is required.
- Store secrets and credentials in Azure Key Vault, not in notebooks or code.
- Regularly review and update cluster policies and permissions.
