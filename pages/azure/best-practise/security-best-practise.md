# Security Best Practise

Azure Security Best Practices refers to a set of guidelines and recommendations that are designed to help you secure your applications, data, and infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. By following these best practices, you can help protect your organization from security threats and ensure that your Azure environment is compliant with industry standards and regulations.

Here are some Azure Security Best Practices that you should consider:

1. _**Use Azure Security Center: Azure Security Center provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring the security of your Azure resources. It can help you identify security threats and vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for how to mitigate them.**_
2. _**Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enabling MFA can help prevent unauthorized access to your Azure resources by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password.**_
3. _**Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs): NSGs allow you to control traffic to and from your Azure resources by creating security rules that allow or deny traffic based on its source, destination, and port.**_
4. _**Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC allows you to control access to your Azure resources by assigning users and groups to roles that determine what actions they can take.**_
5. _**Keep your Azure resources up to date: Regularly updating your Azure resources with the latest security patches and software updates can help prevent security vulnerabilities.**_
6. _**Use Azure Key Vault: Azure Key Vault provides a secure way to store and manage cryptographic keys, certificates, and secrets that are used by your applications and services.**_
7. _**Use Azure Backup: Azure Backup provides a simple and secure way to protect your data and applications on Azure by backing them up to the cloud.**_
8. _**Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Protection: Azure AD Identity Protection can help you detect and prevent identity-based attacks by analyzing user behavior and applying risk-based conditional access policies**_.

By following these best practices, you can help ensure that your Azure environment is secure and compliant with industry standards and regulations. It is important to regularly review and update your security practices to adapt to new threats and vulnerabilities.
