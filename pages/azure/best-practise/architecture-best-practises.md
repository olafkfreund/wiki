# Architecture Best Practises



1. Better Security: With a hub and spoke architecture, the hub acts as a central point for security and network traffic management. This allows for better control of network traffic between the spokes and reduces the risk of security breaches.
2. Improved Network Performance: The hub and spoke architecture allows for a more efficient use of network resources, as traffic between the spokes can be optimized and prioritized through the hub. This can improve network performance and reduce latency.
3. Simplified Management: The hub and spoke architecture enables centralized management of network resources, reducing the complexity of managing multiple interconnected networks. This can lead to easier troubleshooting and more streamlined IT operations.
4. Scalability: The hub and spoke architecture is highly scalable, as additional spokes can be added as needed without impacting the central hub or other spokes. This makes it an ideal architecture for growing organizations or those with changing needs.
5. Cost-Effective: By consolidating network resources in a central hub, organizations can reduce the need for redundant infrastructure and simplify their network architecture, resulting in cost savings.

Overall, the Azure hub and spoke architecture provides a secure, efficient, and scalable approach to network design that can simplify management and reduce costs.
