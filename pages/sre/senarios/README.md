# SRE Scenarios

This section contains practical scenarios for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) with real-world implementation examples. Each scenario presents a common challenge faced in production environments and provides a complete solution with code and deployment instructions.

## Available Scenarios

- [AWS VM Log Monitoring API](aws-vm-monitoring-api.md): Create a lightweight Golang-based API that exposes application logs from EC2 instances for monitoring systems

## Purpose

These scenarios are designed to help SREs:

1. Understand practical implementation patterns for solving common reliability challenges
2. Learn how to design and implement robust monitoring solutions
3. Gain hands-on experience with technologies used in SRE practice
4. Demonstrate end-to-end solutions from problem statement to deployment

## Contributing

To contribute a new scenario, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new markdown file in the scenarios directory
2. Include a clear problem statement that describes a real-world challenge
3. Provide a complete solution with code and implementation details
4. Include deployment instructions and troubleshooting guidance
5. Add the scenario to the SUMMARY.md file under the SRE section
