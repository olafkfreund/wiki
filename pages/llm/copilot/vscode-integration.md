## Setup and Configuration

### Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Navigate to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot"

2. Search for "Copilot"
3. Adjust the following key settings:

| Setting | Description | Recommended Value |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|

| Filter Suggestions | Filter out suggestions matching certain patterns | Based on preference |
| Language Support | Enable/disable for specific languages | Enable for your primary languages |

## Basic Usage

### Code Suggestions

GitHub Copilot provides real-time code suggestions as you type:

1. Start typing code or add comments describing what you want to do
2. Copilot will display ghosted text suggestions
3. Accept suggestions with Tab or continue typing to reject

```python
# Example: A function that calculates factorial
def factorial(n):  # Copilot will suggest the implementation
```

### Using Comments to Guide Copilot

Use descriptive comments to get more accurate suggestions:

```javascript
// Create a function that fetches user data from an API and returns a formatted object
async function fetchUserData(userId) {  // Copilot will suggest implementation
```

### Multiple Suggestions

View alternative suggestions:

1. Press `Alt+]` (Windows/Linux) or `Option+]` (Mac) to see the next suggestion
2. Press `Alt+[` (Windows/Linux) or `Option+[` (Mac) to see the previous suggestion
3. Press `Alt+\` (Windows/Linux) or `Option+\` (Mac) to open a separate panel with multiple suggestions

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Copilot Chat

Copilot Chat provides an interactive way to get coding assistance:

1. Open the Copilot Chat panel (using the Copilot icon in the sidebar)
2. Type questions or requests in natural language
3. Use slash commands for specific actions:

Common slash commands:
- `/explain` - Explain the selected code
- `/tests` - Generate tests for the selected code
- `/fix` - Suggest fixes for problems in the selected code
- `/optimize` - Optimize the selected code

### Code Completion vs. Code Generation

- **Code Completion**: Small, contextual suggestions while typing
- **Code Generation**: Creating entire functions or code blocks

For code generation:
1. Write a detailed comment describing what you need
2. Press Enter to create a new line
3. Wait for Copilot to generate a suggestion
4. Press Tab to accept or continue typing to reject

### Custom Settings for DevOps Tasks

Optimize Copilot for DevOps work:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "yaml": true,
    "plaintext": false,
    "markdown": true,
    "terraform": true,
    "dockerfile": true
  },
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "indentationMode": true,
    "listCount": 10
  }
}
```

## Real-World DevOps Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Creating Terraform Infrastructure

```hcl
# Create an AWS EC2 instance with the following specifications:
# - t3.medium instance type
# - Amazon Linux 2 AMI
# - 20GB EBS volume
# - In a private subnet with a security group allowing SSH access
```

### Scenario 2: Writing a GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
# - Runs on pull requests to main branch
# - Sets up a Python 3.9 environment
# - Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
# - Runs pytest with coverage
# - Uploads coverage report as an artifact
```

### Scenario 3: Creating a Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
# Create a Kubernetes deployment for a web application with:
# - 3 replicas
# - Container using nginx:latest image
# - Resource limits: 256Mi RAM, 500m CPU
# - Health check on port 80
# - Service exposing port 80 with LoadBalancer
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Accept suggestion | Tab | Tab |
| Dismiss suggestion | Esc | Esc |
| Show next suggestion | Alt+] | Option+] |
| Show previous suggestion | Alt+[ | Option+[ |
| Open Copilot panel | Alt+\ | Option+\ |
| Open Copilot Chat | Ctrl+Shift+I | Cmd+Shift+I |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No suggestions appearing**
   - Check if Copilot is enabled for the current language
   - Try restarting VS Code
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Poor quality suggestions**
   - Improve your comments with more detail
   - Add more context to your code
   - Try different ways of describing what you want

3. **High latency**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Close unnecessary extensions
   - Reduce the size of the file you're working on
