# Credential Scanning in Modern DevOps (2025)

Credential scanning is a critical security practice that automatically inspects code and infrastructure to prevent secrets from being exposed in source code, configuration files, or infrastructure definitions. This includes sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, access tokens, certificates, and service principal credentials.

## Modern DevOps Approach to Credential Scanning

### 1. Shift-Left Security
- Integrate scanning in IDE and local development
- Pre-commit and pre-push git hooks
- Pull request validation gates
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning

### 2. Multi-Layer Protection
- Local developer environment checks
- Repository branch protection rules
- Automated CI/CD pipeline scanning
- Runtime secret detection
- Cloud service configuration auditing

## Implementation Strategies

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
name: Credential Scanning
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  secret-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      # TruffleHog Scanner
      - name: TruffleHog OSS
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
        with:
          path: ./
          base: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}
          head: HEAD
          
      # Gitleaks Scanner
      - name: Gitleaks
        uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
      # Detect-secrets
      - name: Detect-secrets
        uses: reviewdog/action-detect-secrets@v0.12
        with:
          reporter: github-pr-review

      # SAST with Secret Detection
      - name: Run Semgrep
        uses: semgrep/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          config: p/secrets
```

### Azure DevOps Pipeline Integration
```yaml
trigger:
  - main
  - feature/*

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: CredScan@3
  inputs:
    toolVersion: 'latest'
    scanFolder: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)'
    outputFormat: 'sarif'
    
- task: PostAnalysis@1
  inputs:
    AllTools: false
    APIScan: false
    BinSkim: false
    CodesignValidation: false
    CredScan: true
    FortifySCA: false
    FxCop: false
    ModernCop: false
    PoliCheck: false
    RoslynAnalyzers: false
    SDLNativeRules: false
    Semmle: false
    TSLint: false
    WebScout: false

- task: ComponentGovernanceComponentDetection@0
  inputs:
    scanType: 'Register'
    verbosity: 'Verbose'
    alertWarningLevel: 'High'
```

## Modern Tools and Services (2025)

### Cloud-Native Scanning
- **Azure Key Vault Scanner** - Scans for misconfigurations and access policies
- **AWS Secrets Manager Detection** - Integrated with AWS Security Hub
- **Google Secret Manager Audit** - Part of Google Cloud Security Command Center

### Advanced Scanning Tools

### GitOps Security Tools
- **Flux Secret Management** - GitOps-native secret handling
- **ArgoCD Vault Plugin** - Kubernetes secrets integration
- **External Secrets Operator** - Cloud-native secret management

## Best Practices

### 1. Secret Management
```yaml
# Kubernetes External Secrets Example
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: app-secrets
spec:
  refreshInterval: "1h"
  secretStoreRef:
    kind: SecretStore
    name: azure-store
  target:
    name: app-secrets
  data:
    - secretKey: DB_PASSWORD
      remoteRef:
        key: production/db/password
```

### 2. CI/CD Security Gates
```yaml
# Example Quality Gate Configuration
security_gates:
  secret_scan:
    max_severity: CRITICAL
    fail_on_detection: true
    notify_channels:
      - security-team
      - development-leads
    exceptions:
      - pattern: "test-data-fixture"
        justification: "Required for integration tests"
        expires: "2025-12-31"
```

- Security incident response automation
- Compliance reporting and auditing
- Trend analysis and risk assessment

## Advanced Features

### 1. Machine Learning Detection

# OPA Policy Example
package secrets

deny[msg] {
    input.type == "Secret"
    not valid_naming_convention
    msg = "Secret does not follow naming convention"
}

valid_naming_convention {
    regex.match("^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$", input.metadata.name)
}
```
