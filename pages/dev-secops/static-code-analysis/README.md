# Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is a method of detecting security issues by examining the source code of the application.

### Why Static Code Analysis <a href="#why-static-code-analysis" id="why-static-code-analysis"></a>

Compared to code reviews, Static code analysis tools are more fast, accurate and through. As it operates on the source code itself, it is an early indicator for issues, and coding errors found earlier are less costly to fix.

### Applying Static Code Analysis <a href="#applying-static-code-analysis" id="applying-static-code-analysis"></a>

Static Code Analysis should be integrated in your build process. There are [many tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source\_Code\_Analysis\_Tools) available for Static Code Analysis, choose the ones that meet your programming language and development techniques.

### Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>

Static code analysis is essential to identify potential problems and security issues in the code. It allows you to detect bugs and security issues at an early stage.
