# Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is a method of detecting security issues by examining the source code of the application.

### Why Static Code Analysis <a href="#why-static-code-analysis" id="why-static-code-analysis"></a>

Compared to code reviews, Static code analysis tools are more fast, accurate and through. As it operates on the source code itself, it is a very early indicator for issues, and coding errors found earlier are less costly to fix.

### Applying Static Code Analysis <a href="#applying-static-code-analysis" id="applying-static-code-analysis"></a>

Static Code Analysis should be integrated in your build process. There are [many tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source\_Code\_Analysis\_Tools) available for Static Code Analysis, choose the ones that meet your programming language and development techniques.

### Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>

Static code analysis is essential to identify potential problems and security issues in the code. It allows you to detect bugs and security issues at an early stage.
