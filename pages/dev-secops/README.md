# Dev SecOps

Dev SecOps is a term used to describe the integration of security practices into DevOps processes. Dev SecOps seeks to ensure that security is integrated into every stage of the development and deployment process, from design to testing to deployment.

Real-life examples of Dev SecOps practices in Azure include:

1. Compliance Scanning: Azure Security Center provides compliance scanning capabilities, allowing organizations to scan for compliance with regulatory standards such as HIPAA and PCI DSS.
2. Threat Detection: Azure Security Center provides threat detection capabilities, allowing organizations to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.
3. Identity and Access Management: Azure Active Directory provides identity and access management capabilities, allowing organizations to control access to Azure resources and manage user identities.
4. Encryption: Azure provides encryption capabilities for data in transit and at rest, ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized access.
5. Vulnerability Scanning: Azure Security Center provides vulnerability scanning capabilities, allowing organizations to scan for vulnerabilities in their Azure resources and take corrective action.

By integrating security practices into DevOps processes, organizations can improve their security posture and reduce the risk of security breaches. Dev SecOps practices can help organizations to identify and respond to security threats in real-time, ensuring that their Azure resources are protected from unauthorized access and other security risks. Overall, Dev SecOps is an important approach to security in Azure, helping organizations to ensure the security and compliance of their Azure resources.
