# Migrating from GCP to AWS: A Practical Guide for Cloud Architects and DevOps Engineers

Migrating from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to Amazon Web Services (AWS) requires careful planning, mapping of services, and process adaptation. This guide provides actionable steps, real-life examples, and best practices for a successful migration.

## Quick Comparison: GCP vs AWS Services

| GCP Service                | AWS Equivalent           | Notes                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Compute Engine             | EC2                      | VM types and images differ               |
| Cloud Storage              | S3                       | APIs and access models vary              |
| Cloud IAM                  | IAM                      | RBAC and identity federation differ      |
| Cloud SQL                  | RDS                      | Migration tools available                |
| Cloud Functions            | Lambda                   | Triggers and bindings differ             |
| Deployment Manager         | CloudFormation           | Syntax and capabilities differ           |
| Stackdriver Monitoring     | CloudWatch               | Metrics and logging integration varies   |
| VPC                        | VPC                      | Subnet and peering models differ         |
| GKE (Kubernetes Engine)    | EKS                      | Cluster management differs               |
| Cloud DNS                  | Route 53                 | Record types and automation differ       |

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] **Inventory GCP Resources**  
  Use gcloud CLI:  
  `gcloud asset search-all-resources --format=json > gcp-inventory.json`
- [ ] **Map GCP Services to AWS Equivalents**  
  Create a mapping table for all services in use.
- [ ] **Assess Application Dependencies**  
  Identify hardcoded endpoints, region-specific services, and OS dependencies.
- [ ] **Plan Identity and Access Migration**  
  Prepare to migrate Cloud IAM users/groups to AWS IAM.
- [ ] **Network Planning**  
  Design AWS VPCs to match or improve your GCP VPC topology.
- [ ] **Translate Infrastructure as Code**  
  Convert Deployment Manager templates to CloudFormation or Terraform.
- [ ] **Migrate Data**  
  Use AWS CLI S3 sync or AWS DataSync for storage migration.
- [ ] **Migrate Identity**  
  Set up AWS IAM, and test user access.
- [ ] **Refactor Applications**  
  Update code/configs to use AWS SDKs and endpoints.
- [ ] **Test and Validate**  
  Use CloudWatch and X-Ray for validation.
- [ ] **Update DNS**  
  Point domains to AWS endpoints (Route 53).
- [ ] **Monitor and Optimize**  
  Use AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor.
- [ ] **Decommission GCP Resources**  
  Confirm all data is migrated and backups are complete before deleting.
- [ ] **Update Documentation**  
  Revise runbooks and architecture diagrams.

## Migration Steps (with Examples)

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Translation

- **Example:** Convert Deployment Manager templates to CloudFormation or Terraform.
  - Use [dm-convert](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples/tree/master/tools/dm-convert) to export, then adapt to AWS.
  - Example Terraform snippet for AWS EC2:

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
      # ...
    }
    ```

### 2. Data Migration

- **Example:** Migrate Cloud Storage buckets to S3 using [AWS CLI S3 sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html):

  ```sh
  aws s3 sync "gs://my-gcp-bucket" s3://my-aws-bucket --recursive
  ```

### 3. Identity Migration

- **Example:** Sync GCP IAM users to AWS IAM using [AWS SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/azure-ad-idp.html) or SAML federation.

### 4. Application Refactoring

- Update code/configs to use AWS SDKs and endpoints.
- Replace GCP Cloud Functions triggers with Lambda event sources.

### 5. Testing and Validation

- Use CloudWatch and X-Ray for post-migration validation.

## Post-Migration Tasks

- **Update DNS:** Point domains to AWS endpoints (e.g., Route 53).
- **Monitor and Optimize:** Use AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor.
- **Decommission GCP Resources:** Ensure all data is migrated and backups are complete before deleting.
- **Documentation:** Update runbooks and architecture diagrams.

---

## Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Start with Non-Production Workloads:** Validate migration steps before moving critical systems.
- **Automate Everything:** Use Terraform/Ansible for repeatable deployments.
- **Watch for Service Limits:** AWS and GCP have different quotas.
- **Security Review:** Reassess security groups, NACLs, and IAM/RBAC policies.
