# Migrating from AWS to Azure: A Practical Guide for Cloud Architects and DevOps Engineers

Migrating from AWS to Azure involves more than just moving workloads—it's about understanding service equivalencies, planning for differences, and ensuring a smooth transition for your teams and applications. This guide provides actionable steps, real-life examples, and best practices for a successful migration.

## Quick Comparison: AWS vs Azure Services

| AWS Service                | Azure Equivalent           | Notes                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| EC2                       | Virtual Machines (VMs)    | VM sizes and images differ               |
| S3                        | Blob Storage              | APIs and access models vary              |
| IAM                       | Azure Active Directory    | RBAC models differ                       |
| RDS                       | Azure SQL Database        | Migration tools available                |
| Lambda                    | Azure Functions           | Triggers and bindings differ             |
| CloudFormation            | ARM Templates/Bicep       | Syntax and capabilities differ           |
| CloudWatch                | Azure Monitor             | Metrics and logging integration varies   |
| VPC                       | Virtual Network (VNet)    | Subnet and peering models differ         |
| EKS                       | AKS (Azure Kubernetes)    | Cluster management differs               |
| Route 53                  | Azure DNS                 | Record types and automation differ       |

> **Tip:** [Microsoft's official service mapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/aws-professional/services) is a great reference.

## Pre-Migration Checklist

1. **Inventory Your AWS Resources**
   - Use AWS Config or AWS CLI to export a list of resources:

     ```sh
     aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources > aws-inventory.json
     ```

2. **Map Services to Azure Equivalents**
   - Create a mapping document for each AWS service in use.
3. **Assess Application Dependencies**
   - Identify hardcoded endpoints, region-specific services, and OS dependencies.
4. **Plan Identity and Access Migration**
   - Prepare to migrate IAM users/groups to Azure AD.
5. **Network Planning**
   - Design Azure VNets to match (or improve) your AWS VPC topology.

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] **Inventory AWS Resources**  
  Use AWS CLI:  
  `aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources > aws-inventory.json`
- [ ] **Map AWS Services to Azure Equivalents**  
  Create a mapping table for all services in use.
- [ ] **Assess Application Dependencies**  
  Identify hardcoded endpoints, region-specific services, and OS dependencies.
- [ ] **Plan Identity and Access Migration**  
  Prepare to migrate IAM users/groups to Azure AD.
- [ ] **Network Planning**  
  Design Azure VNets to match or improve your AWS VPC topology.
- [ ] **Translate Infrastructure as Code**  
  Convert CloudFormation templates to ARM/Bicep or Terraform.
- [ ] **Migrate Data**  
  Use AzCopy or Azure Data Factory for storage migration.
- [ ] **Migrate Identity**  
  Set up Azure AD, and test user access.
- [ ] **Refactor Applications**  
  Update code/configs to use Azure SDKs and endpoints.
- [ ] **Test and Validate**  
  Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights for validation.
- [ ] **Update DNS**  
  Point domains to Azure endpoints (Azure DNS).
- [ ] **Monitor and Optimize**  
  Use Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor.
- [ ] **Decommission AWS Resources**  
  Confirm all data is migrated and backups are complete before deleting.
- [ ] **Update Documentation**  
  Revise runbooks and architecture diagrams.

## Migration Steps (with Examples)

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Translation

- **Example:** Convert CloudFormation templates to Azure Bicep or ARM templates.
  - Use [Former2](https://former2.com/) to export AWS resources to Terraform, then adapt to Azure.
  - Example Terraform snippet for Azure VM:

    ```hcl
    resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
      name                  = "example-vm"
      resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
      location              = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
      # ...
    }
    ```

### 2. Data Migration

- **Example:** Migrate S3 buckets to Azure Blob Storage using [AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10):

  ```sh
  azcopy copy "s3://mybucket" "https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>" --recursive
  ```

### 3. Identity Migration

- **Example:** Sync AWS IAM users to Azure AD using [Azure AD Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-custom).

### 4. Application Refactoring

- Update code/configs to use Azure SDKs and endpoints.
- Replace AWS Lambda triggers with Azure Function bindings.

### 5. Testing and Validation

- Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights for post-migration validation.

## Post-Migration Tasks

- **Update DNS:** Point domains to Azure endpoints (e.g., Azure DNS).
- **Monitor and Optimize:** Use Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor.
- **Decommission AWS Resources:** Ensure all data is migrated and backups are complete before deleting.
- **Documentation:** Update runbooks and architecture diagrams.

---

## Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Start with Non-Production Workloads:** Validate migration steps before moving critical systems.
- **Automate Everything:** Use Terraform/Ansible for repeatable deployments.
- **Watch for Service Limits:** Azure and AWS have different quotas.
- **Security Review:** Reassess security groups, NSGs, and IAM/RBAC policies.

## Cloud Hopping Humor

> Why did the DevOps engineer bring a parachute to the cloud migration?
>
> Because you never know when you’ll need to drop out of AWS and land safely in Azure!
