# Terraform Tools Overview

This section covers essential tools for Terraform development that help maintain code quality, security, and documentation. Each tool serves a specific purpose in the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) lifecycle.

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Primary Use | When to Use |
|------|------------|-------------|
| [terraform-docs](terraform-docs.md) | Documentation Generation | Use when you need to generate documentation for Terraform modules automatically |
| [TFLint](tflint.md) | Linting & Best Practices | Use during development to catch errors and enforce style conventions |
| [Checkov](checkov.md) | Security & Compliance Scanning | Use to identify security misconfigurations and compliance violations |
| [Terrascan](terrascan.md) | Security Policy Enforcement | Use for deep security analysis and custom policy enforcement |

## Tool Integration Points

### Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**
   - TFLint for real-time linting
   - terraform-docs for module documentation
   - Pre-commit hooks for all tools

2. **Code Review**
   - Checkov for security review
   - Terrascan for policy compliance
   - terraform-docs for documentation verification

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - All tools integrated into the pipeline
   - Blocking builds on critical issues
   - Generating reports for audit

## Tool Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Tool

1. **terraform-docs**
   - Creating new modules
   - Updating existing modules
   - Preparing for code review
   - Documentation maintenance

2. **TFLint**
   - During active development
   - Before committing code
   - In CI/CD pipelines
   - Code style enforcement

3. **Checkov**
   - Security assessments
   - Compliance audits
   - Pre-deployment checks
   - Regular security scans

4. **Terrascan**
   - Custom policy enforcement
   - Deep security analysis
   - Compliance validation
   - Infrastructure audits

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Install all tools
   brew install terraform-docs tflint checkov
   curl -L "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/tenable/terrascan/releases/latest | grep -o -E "https://.+?_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz")" > terrascan.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Pre-commit Configuration**
   ```yaml
   repos:
   - repo: https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs
     rev: "v0.16.0"
     hooks:
       - id: terraform-docs
   - repo: https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint
     rev: "v0.44.1"
     hooks:
       - id: tflint
   - repo: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov
     rev: "2.3.234"
     hooks:
       - id: checkov
   - repo: https://github.com/tenable/terrascan
     rev: "v1.18.1"
     hooks:
       - id: terrascan
   ```

3. **CI/CD Implementation**
   ```yaml
   # Example GitHub Actions workflow
   name: IaC Security & Quality
   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     security:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         
         - name: terraform-docs
           uses: terraform-docs/gh-actions@v1.0.0
           
         - name: tflint
           uses: terraform-linters/setup-tflint@v3
           
         - name: checkov
           uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
           
         - name: terrascan
           uses: tenable/terrascan-action@main
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Tool Configuration**
   - Use configuration files for each tool
   - Document exceptions and suppressions
   - Version control all configurations
   - Regular configuration review

2. **Integration**
   - Implement all tools locally first
   - Add pre-commit hooks
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines
   - Set up reporting and notifications

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep tools updated
   - Review and update policies
   - Monitor tool performance
   - Adjust configurations as needed
