# Terraform Testing Strategies

This section covers comprehensive testing strategies for Terraform infrastructure code, reflecting modern practices as of 2025. Testing infrastructure as code is crucial for maintaining reliable and secure cloud deployments.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing approach follows a pyramid structure:

1. **Unit Tests** - Testing individual modules and resources
   - Fast execution
   - High isolation
   - Focused on configuration validation
   - See: [Unit Testing Guide](unit-testing.md)

2. **Integration Tests** - Testing module interactions
   - Tests multiple modules together
   - Validates resource dependencies
   - Ensures proper configuration sharing
   - See: [Integration Testing Guide](integration-testing.md)

3. **End-to-End Tests** - Testing complete infrastructure
   - Tests full deployments
   - Validates real-world scenarios
   - Includes performance and scalability
   - See: [E2E Testing Guide](e2e-testing.md)

## Testing Framework

We recommend using Terratest as the primary testing framework for Terraform:

- Mature and widely adopted
- Strong community support
- Comprehensive feature set
- Cloud provider support
- See: [Terratest Guide](terratest.md)

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Environment Management

- Use separate state files for tests
- Implement proper cleanup procedures
- Use unique identifiers for test resources
- Implement proper access controls

### 2. Test Data Handling

- Use mock data when possible
- Implement data cleanup procedures
- Handle sensitive information properly
- Use environment variables for credentials

### 3. Continuous Integration

- Automate test execution
- Implement proper test reporting
- Set up notifications for failures
- Track test coverage

### 4. Security Considerations

- Test security configurations
- Validate access controls
- Check for compliance requirements
- Test encryption settings

## Tools and Resources

- Terratest for test implementation
- AWS/Azure/GCP testing tools
- CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)
- Monitoring and logging tools
