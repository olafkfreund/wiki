# Progressive Delivery Patterns

### Ring-Based Deployment Strategy

```ascii
Production Ring Deployment:
Ring 0 (Canaries) → Ring 1 (Early) → Ring 2 (Default) → Ring 3 (Late)
     [1% users]       [5% users]        [84% users]       [10% users]
        ↓                ↓                  ↓                 ↓
    DevTeam       Early Adopters      Main Users        Conservative
```
