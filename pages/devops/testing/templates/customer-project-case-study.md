# ~Customer Project~ Case Study

---

## Background

Provide a concise summary of the customer, their business requirements, and the explicit problem statement. For example:

> **Example:**
> A fintech client required a scalable, secure payment processing platform on AWS, with strict compliance and high availability. The main challenge was ensuring end-to-end reliability across microservices and third-party integrations.

---

## System Under Test (SUT)

Describe the conceptual architecture. Include a diagram if possible.

- **Cloud Provider:** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Key Components:**
  - API Gateway
  - Microservices (ECS/EKS/AKS/GKE)
  - Databases (RDS, CosmosDB, Cloud SQL)
  - Message Queues (SQS, Service Bus, Pub/Sub)
  - Third-party APIs

> **Tip:** Highlight which components were included in E2E testing.

---

## Problems and Limitations

- List any blockers that prevented full E2E coverage (e.g., unavailable test data, third-party sandbox limitations).
- Note limitations of tools/frameworks (e.g., lack of support for async workflows, limited cloud integration).

---

## E2E Testing Framework and Tools

- **Frameworks:** Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, REST Assured, Postman, k6, etc.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, GitLab CI/CD
- **IaC/Provisioning:** Terraform, Ansible
- **Cloud Integrations:** AWS CodeBuild, Azure DevOps, GCP Cloud Build

> **Best Practice:** Use containerized test runners for consistency across environments.

---

## Test Cases

- List key E2E scenarios (e.g., user registration, payment flow, error handling, failover, scaling events).
- For each, specify:
  - Preconditions
  - Steps
  - Expected outcomes

---

## Test Metrics

- **Monitoring:** Cloud-native tools (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Operations Suite)
- **Metrics:**
  - Response time
  - Error rate
  - Throughput
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
- **Test Progress:**
  - Number of tests passed/failed
  - Coverage percentage

---

## E2E Testing Architecture

- Describe the test execution environment (e.g., ephemeral test environments via Terraform, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes).
- Diagram or list how tests are triggered (e.g., on PR, nightly, pre-release).
- Note use of mocks/stubs for unavailable dependencies.

---

## E2E Testing Implementation (Code samples)

> **Example: Playwright (TypeScript) API Test**

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('User can register and login', async ({ request }) => {
  const register = await request.post('/api/register', { data: { user: 'alice', pass: 'secret' } });
  expect(register.ok()).toBeTruthy();
  const login = await request.post('/api/login', { data: { user: 'alice', pass: 'secret' } });
  expect(login.ok()).toBeTruthy();
});
```

> **Reusable Terraform Block for Test Environment**

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "test_db" {
  allocated_storage    = 20
  engine              = "postgres"
  instance_class      = "db.t3.micro"
  name                = "testdb"
  username            = var.db_user
  password            = var.db_pass
  skip_final_snapshot = true
}
```

---

## E2E Testing Reporting and Results

- Include sample test reports (e.g., JUnit XML, Allure, HTML dashboards).
- Summarize key findings (e.g., pass rate, critical failures, performance bottlenecks).
- Example:

```text
E2E Test Summary:
- Total: 120
- Passed: 117
- Failed: 3
- Avg. Response Time: 320ms
- Error Rate: 0.8%
```

---

> **Best Practices:**
> - Automate E2E tests in CI/CD pipelines
> - Use cloud-native monitoring for real-time feedback
> - Parameterize test data and environments
> - Integrate LLMs for test case generation and log analysis
