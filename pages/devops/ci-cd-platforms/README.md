# CI/CD Platforms

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a software development practice that aims to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.

Continuous Integration involves developers frequently merging their code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests are run to ensure that the new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.

Continuous Delivery builds upon Continuous Integration by automating the release process, allowing teams to deploy changes to production quickly and efficiently. This involves automating the build, testing, and deployment processes, and can include techniques such as blue-green deployments, canary releases, and feature toggles.

CI/CD helps teams to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace, with fewer errors and less risk. By automating the build and deployment processes, developers can focus on writing code, while automated tests ensure that changes do not introduce new bugs or compatibility issues.
