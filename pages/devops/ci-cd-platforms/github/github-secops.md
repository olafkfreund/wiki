# GitHub SecOps: DevSecOps Pipeline Example

A robust DevSecOps pipeline in GitHub Actions integrates security at every stage of your CI/CD process. Below is a practical example covering secrets detection, SAST, SCA, container scanning, DAST, and system auditing.

```yaml
name: DevSecOps Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Secret scanning (GitGuardian or truffleHog recommended)
      - name: Secret Scan (truffleHog)
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@v3
        with:
          scan: true

      # Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with SonarCloud
      - name: SAST (SonarCloud)
        uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@v2
        env:
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        with:
          projectKey: ${{ secrets.SONAR_PROJECT_KEY }}

      # Software Composition Analysis (SCA) with OWASP Dependency-Check
      - name: SCA (OWASP Dependency-Check)
        uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@v3
        with:
          project: my-app
          format: 'HTML'
          out: 'reports'

      # Container image scanning with Trivy
      - name: Container Scan (Trivy)
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.14.0
        with:
          image-ref: 'myorg/myimage:latest'

      # Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP
      - name: DAST (OWASP ZAP)
        uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v0.7.0
        with:
          target: 'https://your-app-url.com'

      # System Security Audit (Lynis)
      - name: System Security Audit (Lynis)
        uses: docker://cisagov/lynis
        with:
          args: audit system

      # Optional: Bug tracking integration (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues)
      # - name: Create Issue on Failure
      #   uses: actions/github-script@v7
      #   if: failure()
      #   with:
      #     script: |
      #       // Create an issue or notify on failure
```

**Pipeline Stages Explained:**
- **Secret Scanning:** Detects hardcoded secrets using truffleHog or GitGuardian.
- **SAST:** Analyzes code for vulnerabilities before deployment (SonarCloud).
- **SCA:** Checks dependencies for known vulnerabilities (OWASP Dependency-Check).
- **Container Scanning:** Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities (Trivy).
- **DAST:** Tests running applications for security issues (OWASP ZAP).
- **System Audit:** Runs a system-level security audit (Lynis).
- **Bug Tracking:** Optionally create issues for failed security checks.

## Best Practices
- Store all tokens and credentials in [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
- Use [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) to enforce security checks before merging.
- Regularly update action versions to include the latest security patches.
- Review [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security) for built-in secret scanning and code scanning.
