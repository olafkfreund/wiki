### Running K8sGPT through a container <a href="#running-k8sgpt-through-a-container" id="running-k8sgpt-through-a-container"></a>

If you are running K8sGPT through a container, the CLI will not be able to open the website for the OpenAI token.

You can find the latest container image for K8sGPT in the packages of the GitHub organisation: [Link](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt/pkgs/container/k8sgpt)

A volume can then be mounted to the image through e.g. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). Below is an example:

```bash
version: '2'
services:
 k8sgpt:
   image: ghcr.io/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt:dev-202304011623
   volumes:
     -  /home/$(whoami)/.k8sgpt.yaml:/home/root/.k8sgpt.yaml
```plaintext

### Authenticate with OpenAI <a href="#authenticate-with-openai" id="authenticate-with-openai"></a>

First, you will need to authenticate with your chosen backend. The backend is the AI provider such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.

[Ensure that you have created an account.](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login)

Next, generate a token from the backend:

```bash
k8sgpt generate
```plaintext

This will provide you with a URL to generate a token, follow the URL from the command line to your browser to then generate the token.

For a more engaging experience and a better understanding of the capabilities of `k8sgpt` and LLMs (Large Language Models), run the following command:

```bash
k8sgpt analyse --explain
```plaintext

Congratulations! you have successfully created a local kubernetes cluster, deployed a "broken Pod" and analyzed it using `k8sgpt`.
