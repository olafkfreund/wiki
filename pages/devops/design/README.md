# Design

Designing software well is hard. Almost as hard as explaining to management why "making it cloud-native" isn't just putting a sticker of a cloud on the server.

> Q: How many software engineers does it take to design a system?
> A: None - they're all too busy arguing about tabs vs spaces in the design doc.

And here's one for my DevOps friends:

> A: Docker-doodles with a side of YAML-aise!

But in all seriousness (because someone has to be), I've collected battle-tested practices that help in the design process. This covers everything from technical design to architecture and non-functional requirements gathering. Think of it as your Swiss Army knife for not ending up with a system that looks like it was designed by a committee of cats walking across keyboards.

### The DevOps Philosophy (Now with Comics!)

```ascii
Infrastructure as Code Meeting:
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Dev: I wrote the Terraform!  │
│ Ops: I reviewed the plan     │
│ Dev: Tests are passing...    │
│ Ops: Resources look good...  │
│ Both: Ready to apply?        │
│                              │
│      *deep breath*           │
│                              │
│ terraform apply -auto-approve│
│                              │
│ 🔥 Everything's fine 🔥      │
└──────────────────────────────┘

* **Best Practices**: Clear recommendations for designing software that won't make future maintainers hunt you down
  * Maintainability (because your code will outlive your coffee addiction)
  * Extensibility (for when requirements change... and they will)
  * Sustainability (so Earth doesn't hate us more than it already does)

* **Process Guides**: Checklists and workflows that help ensure your design is solid
  * Architecture decision records (ADRs)
  * Design review processes
  * Common pitfall avoidance strategies

* **Knowledge Base**: Curated resources to accelerate your learning
  * Reference architectures
  * Design patterns
  * Real-world case studies
  * Industry best practices
  * Cloud-native design principles

### Modern Design Considerations

* **Cloud-Native First**: Because everything is cloud these days (even your toaster, probably)
* **Multi-Cloud Reality**: AWS, Azure, and GCP walk into a bar... they're still trying to agree on who pays
* **Security by Design**: Because retrofitting security is like trying to install seatbelts on a moving car
* **Observability**: If you can't measure it, you can't blame it on the network team
* **Sustainability**: Green computing, because our servers should leave a smaller footprint than our office coffee machine

Remember: Good design is like a good joke - if you have to explain it, it probably isn't working.
