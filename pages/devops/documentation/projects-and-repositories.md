# Projects and Repositories

Every source code repository should include documentation that is specific to it (e.g., in a Wiki within the repository), while the project itself should include general documentation that is common to all its associated repositories (e.g., in a Wiki within the backlog management tool).

### Documentation specific to a repository <a href="#documentation-specific-to-a-repository" id="documentation-specific-to-a-repository"></a>

Some sections in the documentation of the repository might point to the projectâ€™s documentation (e.g., Onboarding, Working Agreement, Contributing Guide).
