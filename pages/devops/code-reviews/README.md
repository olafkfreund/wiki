# Code Reviews

Developers and engineers working on projects should conduct peer code reviews on every pull request (or check-in to a shared branch).

### Goals <a href="#goals" id="goals"></a>

Code review is a way to have a conversation about the code where participants will:

* **Improve code quality** by identifying and removing defects before they can be introduced into shared code branches.
* **Learn and grow** by having others review the code, we get exposed to unfamiliar design patterns or languages among other topics, and even break some bad habits.
* **Shared understanding** between the developers over the project's code.
