# Querying Azure PowerShell Output for DevOps & SRE (2025)

Azure PowerShell is a core tool for DevOps and SREs managing Azure infrastructure. Efficiently querying and filtering output is essential for automation, reporting, and troubleshooting.

## Selecting Properties

Use `Select-Object` to choose which properties to display. This is useful for scripting, dashboards, and CI/CD pipelines.

```powershell
Get-AzVM -Name TestVM -ResourceGroupName TestGroup |
  Select-Object -Property *
```

Select specific properties for concise output:

```powershell
Get-AzVM -Name TestVM -ResourceGroupName TestGroup |
  Select-Object -Property Name, VmId, ProvisioningState
```

## Selecting Nested Properties

You can extract nested properties using calculated expressions:

```powershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName TestGroup |
  Select-Object -Property Name, @{label='OSType'; expression={$_.StorageProfile.OSDisk.OSType}}
```

## Filtering Results

Use `Where-Object` to filter objects based on property values. This is critical for automation and compliance checks.

```powershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName TestGroup |
  Where-Object {$_.StorageProfile.OsDisk.OsType -eq 'Linux'} |
  Select-Object -Property Name, VmID, ProvisioningState
```

## Output as JSON or CSV

For integration with other tools or pipelines, output as JSON or CSV:

```powershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName TestGroup |
  Select-Object Name, VmId, ProvisioningState |
  ConvertTo-Json | Out-File vms.json

Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName TestGroup |
  Select-Object Name, VmId, ProvisioningState |
  Export-Csv -Path vms.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

## Best Practices (2025)
- Always filter and select only the properties you need for performance and clarity.
- Use `ConvertTo-Json` for API integrations and automation.
- Use `Export-Csv` for reporting and audits.
- Leverage calculated properties for nested or custom data.
- Use `-ExpandProperty` with `Select-Object` to flatten output when needed.
- For large datasets, consider using `-First` or `-Last` to limit results.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to filter can result in large, unwieldy outputs.
- Not handling nested properties can lead to missing critical data.
- Always check for nulls in nested properties to avoid errors in scripts.
