# Azure Machine Learning

## Overview
Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale.

## Real-life Use Cases
- **Cloud Architect:** Design end-to-end ML pipelines for production workloads.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Automate model deployment and monitoring.

## Terraform Example
```hcl
resource "azurerm_machine_learning_workspace" "main" {
  name                = "mlworkspace"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
}
```

## Bicep Example
```bicep
resource mlWorkspace 'Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces@2023-04-01' = {
  name: 'mlworkspace'
  location: resourceGroup().location
  properties: {}
}
```

## Azure CLI Example
```sh
az ml workspace create --name mlworkspace --resource-group my-rg --location westeurope
```

## Best Practices
- Use pipelines for reproducibility.
- Monitor model drift and retrain as needed.

## Common Pitfalls
- Not securing endpoints.
- Underestimating storage needs for training data.

> **Joke:** Why did the ML model go to Azure ML? To get some cloud training!
