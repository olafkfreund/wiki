# Azure Batch

## Overview
Azure Batch runs large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) applications efficiently in the cloud.

## Real-life Use Cases
- **Cloud Architect:** Design scalable scientific computing pipelines.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Automate nightly ETL jobs for data warehouses.

## Terraform Example
```hcl
resource "azurerm_batch_account" "main" {
  name                = "mybatchaccount"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
}
```

## Bicep Example
```bicep
resource batchAccount 'Microsoft.Batch/batchAccounts@2023-05-01' = {
  name: 'mybatchaccount'
  location: resourceGroup().location
}
```

## Azure CLI Example
```sh
az batch account create --name mybatchaccount --resource-group my-rg --location westeurope
```

## Best Practices
- Use pools for efficient resource allocation.
- Monitor job queues for stuck jobs.

## Common Pitfalls
- Insufficient quotas for large jobs.
- Not scaling compute pools appropriately.

> **Joke:** Why did the batch job go to Azure? It heard it could process its feelings in parallel!
