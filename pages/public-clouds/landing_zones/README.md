# Landing Zones in Public Clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP)

A **Landing Zone** is a pre-configured, secure, and scalable cloud environment that provides a baseline for deploying workloads. It includes essential resources, policies, and guardrails to ensure compliance, security, and operational efficiency from day one.

## Why Use Landing Zones?

- Accelerate cloud adoption with ready-to-use environments
- Enforce security, compliance, and governance standards
- Standardize networking, identity, and resource organization
- Enable multi-account/subscription management

---

## Landing Zone Definitions by Cloud Provider

### Azure: Azure Landing Zone

- **Definition:** A set of guidelines, reference architectures, and automation (often via Azure Blueprints, ARM/Bicep, or Terraform) to deploy a secure, governed Azure environment.
- **Key Features:**
  - Management groups and subscriptions
  - Azure Policy for compliance
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Hub-and-spoke networking
  - Integration with Azure Security Center
- **Reference:** [Azure Landing Zones Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/landing-zones/)

### AWS: AWS Landing Zone / Control Tower

- **Definition:** An automated solution (AWS Control Tower or custom IaC) to set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment with best practices for identity, logging, and networking.
- **Key Features:**
  - Multi-account structure (using AWS Organizations)
  - Centralized logging (CloudTrail, S3)
  - Service Control Policies (SCPs)
  - VPC baseline networking
  - Guardrails for compliance
- **Reference:** [AWS Landing Zone Solution](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-landing-zone/) | [AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/)

### GCP: Google Cloud Landing Zone (Foundation)

- **Definition:** A set of Terraform modules and best practices to create a secure, scalable GCP environment, often called the "foundation" or "landing zone".
- **Key Features:**
  - Hierarchical resource organization (folders, projects)
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Shared VPC and networking
  - Audit logging
  - Security Command Center integration
- **Reference:** [GCP Landing Zone Foundation](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/landing-zones)

## Key Differences Between Cloud Landing Zones

| Feature                | Azure                        | AWS                          | GCP                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Resource Hierarchy     | Management Groups, Subs      | Organizations, Accounts      | Folders, Projects         |
| Automation Tools       | Blueprints, ARM, Bicep, TF   | Control Tower, CloudFormation, TF | Terraform, Deployment Manager |
| Policy/Guardrails      | Azure Policy, RBAC           | SCPs, IAM, Guardrails        | IAM, Org Policy           |
| Networking             | Hub-Spoke, VNet              | VPC, Subnets                 | Shared VPC                |
| Logging & Auditing     | Azure Monitor, Log Analytics | CloudTrail, CloudWatch       | Cloud Audit Logs          |
| Security Integration   | Security Center, Defender    | Security Hub, GuardDuty      | Security Command Center   |

## Best Practices

- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep, CloudFormation) for repeatability
- Start with the official landing zone reference architectures
- Customize guardrails and policies for your organization
- Automate account/subscription/project creation
- Integrate with CI/CD for continuous compliance

## Landing Zone Joke

> Why did the cloud architect refuse to land in an unprepared environment?
>
> Because there was no landing zone—he didn’t want to crash the deployment!
