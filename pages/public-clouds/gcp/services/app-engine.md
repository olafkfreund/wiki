# Platform as a Service (PaaS) in GCP

Google Cloud Platform offers various Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions that allow developers to focus on application development without managing the underlying infrastructure. This page focuses on Google's primary PaaS offerings, with a deep dive into App Engine.

## App Engine

App Engine is Google Cloud's fully managed serverless application platform. It provides a simple way to build and deploy applications that run reliably even under heavy load and with large amounts of data.

### Key Features

- **Zero Server Management**: No need to provision or maintain servers
- **Built-in Services**: Authentication, SQL and NoSQL databases, in-memory caching, load balancing, health checks, logging
- **Automatic Scaling**: Scales applications automatically based on traffic
- **Application Versioning**: Supports multiple versions of applications with traffic splitting
- **Regional Deployment**: Deploy applications in multiple regions for higher availability
- **Custom Domains**: Use your own domains with SSL certificate management
- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Supports Java, Python, Node.js, Go, PHP, and Ruby
- **Standard and Flexible Environments**: Choose between fully managed standard environment or more customizable flexible environment

### App Engine Environments

#### Standard Environment

The Standard Environment runs your application in a secure, sandbox environment:

- Runs on Google-managed servers with fine-grained auto-scaling
- Free tier for low-traffic applications 
- Fast startup times
- Built on container instances running on Google's infrastructure
- Language-specific runtimes (Java, Python, Node.js, Go, PHP, Ruby)

**Limitations**:
- Restricted network access
- No writing to local filesystem
- Language runtime constraints
- No custom system libraries

#### Flexible Environment

The Flexible Environment runs your application in Docker containers on Google's infrastructure:

- Runs on Compute Engine virtual machines
- Support for custom Docker images and any runtime
- SSH access to instances
- No free tier, but more flexible pricing options
- Full access to local disk
- Network access to any service
- Native Dockerfile support
- Custom libraries and binaries

### Deployment with App Engine

#### Using gcloud CLI

```bash
# Initialize your app
gcloud app create --project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

# Deploy your application
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

# Stream logs
gcloud app logs tail -s default

# Open in browser
gcloud app browse
```

#### App Configuration (app.yaml)

Standard Environment (Python example):

```yaml
runtime: python39
service: default

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: auto

env_variables:
  ENVIRONMENT: "production"
```

Flexible Environment (Node.js example):

```yaml
runtime: nodejs
env: flex

resources:
  cpu: 2
  memory_gb: 4
  disk_size_gb: 10

automatic_scaling:
  min_num_instances: 1
  max_num_instances: 10
  cpu_utilization:
    target_utilization: 0.65
```

### Terraform Deployment

```hcl
resource "google_app_engine_application" "app" {
  project     = "my-project-id"
  location_id = "us-central"
  
  # Optional: Database settings
  database_type = "CLOUD_FIRESTORE"
}

resource "google_app_engine_standard_app_version" "app_version" {
  version_id = "v1"
  service    = "default"
  runtime    = "python39"
  
  deployment {
    files {
      name = "main.py"
      source_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/${google_storage_bucket.app_storage.name}/main.py"
    }
    files {
      name = "requirements.txt"
      source_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/${google_storage_bucket.app_storage.name}/requirements.txt"
    }
  }

  entrypoint {
    shell = "gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app"
  }

  env_variables = {
    ENVIRONMENT = "production"
    DB_HOST     = "10.0.0.1"
  }

  automatic_scaling {
    max_concurrent_requests = 50
    min_idle_instances = 1
    max_idle_instances = 5
    min_pending_latency = "1s"
    max_pending_latency = "5s"
  }
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "app_storage" {
  name     = "my-app-source-files"
  location = "US"
}
```

### CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Deploy to App Engine

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Set up Cloud SDK
      uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0.2.0
      with:
        project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
        service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
        export_default_credentials: true
    
    - name: Deploy to App Engine
      run: |
        gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet
```

### Monitoring and Management

- **Cloud Monitoring**: Monitor App Engine applications with metrics, dashboards, and alerts
- **Cloud Logging**: Centralized logging for applications
- **Cloud Trace**: Analyze latency and performance
- **Error Reporting**: Aggregate and display errors
- **Cloud Debugger**: Debug production applications in real-time

## Other PaaS Offerings in GCP

### Cloud Run

Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers that are invocable via web requests or events. It bridges the gap between serverless and containerized applications.

**Key features**:
- Fully managed serverless container environment
- Pay only for what you use (to the nearest 100ms)
- Automatic scaling to zero when not in use
- Support for any programming language via containers
- Built on Knative, an open API and runtime environment

**Example deployment**:

```bash
# Build container
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/myservice

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy myservice --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/myservice --platform managed
```

### Cloud Functions

Google Cloud Functions is an event-driven serverless compute platform. It's integrated with various Google Cloud services through triggers and scales automatically.

**Key features**:
- Event-driven execution
- Automatic scaling
- Pay only for execution time
