# Google Cloud Bigtable: Wide-column NoSQL Database in GCP

Google Cloud Bigtable is GCPâ€™s fully managed, scalable, and high-performance wide-column NoSQL database service. It is designed for large analytical and operational workloads, such as time-series data, IoT, financial data, and user analytics.

## Key Features

- **Massive scalability**: Handles petabytes of data and millions of reads/writes per second
- **Low latency**: Consistent single-digit millisecond response times
- **Fully managed**: No server management, automatic scaling, patching, and backups
- **HBase API compatibility**: Migrate HBase workloads with minimal changes
- **Seamless GCP integration**: Works with Dataflow, Dataproc, BigQuery, and more
- **Replication**: Multi-region replication for high availability

## Architecture Overview

- **Table**: Contains rows, each identified by a unique row key
- **Column families**: Group related columns for storage and performance tuning
- **Cells**: Intersection of row and column, can store multiple timestamped versions
- **Clusters**: Compute resources in one or more GCP regions

## Common Use Cases

- Time-series data (IoT, monitoring, financial ticks)
- Real-time analytics and personalization
- Large-scale graph or recommendation engines
- User profile and event data storage

## Example: Deploying Bigtable with Terraform

```hcl
resource "google_bigtable_instance" "main" {
  name          = "my-bigtable-instance"
  instance_type = "PRODUCTION"
  cluster {
    cluster_id   = "my-bigtable-cluster"
    zone         = "us-central1-b"
    num_nodes    = 3
    storage_type = "SSD"
  }
}

resource "google_bigtable_table" "users" {
  name          = "users"
  instance_name = google_bigtable_instance.main.name
  column_family {
    family = "profile"
  }
  column_family {
    family = "activity"
  }
}
```

## Example: Writing and Reading Data (Python)

```python
from google.cloud import bigtable
client = bigtable.Client(project="my-project", admin=True)
instance = client.instance("my-bigtable-instance")
table = instance.table("users")

# Write a row
direct_row = table.direct_row("user#1234")
direct_row.set_cell("profile", "name", "Alice")
direct_row.set_cell("activity", "last_login", "2024-06-01T12:00:00Z")
direct_row.commit()

# Read a row
row = table.read_row("user#1234")
print(row.cells["profile"][b"name"][0].value)
```

## Best Practices

- **Row key design**: Distribute writes evenly to avoid hotspots (e.g., use hashed prefixes)
- **Column family planning**: Group columns with similar access patterns
- **Monitor performance**: Use GCP Monitoring for CPU, storage, and latency
- **Backup and restore**: Use scheduled backups for disaster recovery
