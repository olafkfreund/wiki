# AWS Batch

## Overview
AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. It dynamically provisions compute resources based on the volume and requirements of submitted jobs.

## Real-life Use Cases
- **Cloud Architect:** Design scalable scientific computing pipelines.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Automate nightly ETL jobs for data warehouses.

## Terraform Example
```hcl
resource "aws_batch_compute_environment" "example" {
  compute_environment_name = "example"
  compute_resources {
    instance_role = aws_iam_instance_profile.ecs_instance.arn
    instance_type = ["m4.large"]
    max_vcpus     = 16
    min_vcpus     = 0
    type          = "EC2"
    subnets       = [aws_subnet.example.id]
    security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.example.id]
  }
  service_role = aws_iam_role.aws_batch_service.arn
  type         = "MANAGED"
}
```

## AWS CLI Example
```sh
aws batch create-compute-environment --compute-environment-name example --type MANAGED --state ENABLED --compute-resources ...
```

## Best Practices
- Use managed compute environments for flexibility.
- Monitor job queues for stuck jobs.

## Common Pitfalls
- Insufficient IAM permissions for job roles.
- Not scaling compute resources appropriately.

> **Joke:** Why did the batch job go to AWS? It heard it could process its feelings in parallel!
