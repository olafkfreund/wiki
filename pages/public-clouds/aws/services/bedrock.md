# Amazon Bedrock

## Overview
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service for building and scaling generative AI applications using foundation models from AWS and leading AI startups.

## Real-life Use Cases
- **Cloud Architect:** Integrate GenAI into customer-facing applications.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Automate content generation and summarization workflows.

## Terraform Example
> **Note:** As of now, Bedrock resources are not natively supported in Terraform. Use AWS CLI or SDKs for automation.

## AWS CLI Example
```sh
aws bedrock list-foundation-models
aws bedrock invoke-model --model-id <model-id> --body '{"inputText": "Hello, world!"}'
```

## Best Practices
- Monitor usage and costs for GenAI workloads.
- Secure API access with IAM policies.

## Common Pitfalls
- Not handling model output validation.
- Underestimating latency for large models.

> **Joke:** Why did the developer use Bedrock? To build a rock-solid GenAI app!
