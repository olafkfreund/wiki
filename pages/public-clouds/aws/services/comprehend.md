# Amazon Comprehend

## Overview
Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text.

## Real-life Use Cases
- **Cloud Architect:** Build sentiment analysis into customer feedback systems.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Automate text classification for support tickets.

## Terraform Example
> **Note:** Comprehend resources are limited in Terraform. Use AWS CLI or SDKs for automation.

## AWS CLI Example
```sh
aws comprehend detect-sentiment --text "AWS is awesome!" --language-code en
```

## Best Practices
- Preprocess text for better accuracy.
- Monitor API usage and costs.

## Common Pitfalls
- Not handling language detection errors.
- Ignoring data privacy for sensitive text.

> **Joke:** Why did Comprehend get promoted? It always understood the assignment!
