# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Overview
Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) for deploying and scaling web applications and services.

## Real-life Use Cases
- **Cloud Architect:** Rapidly prototype and deploy web apps.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Automate blue/green deployments for zero downtime.

## Terraform Example
```hcl
resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment" "app_env" {
  name                = "my-app-env"
  application         = aws_elastic_beanstalk_application.app.name
  solution_stack_name = "64bit Amazon Linux 2 v3.3.6 running Python 3.8"
}

resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_application" "app" {
  name = "my-app"
}
```

## AWS CLI Example
```sh
aws elasticbeanstalk create-application --application-name my-app
aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment --application-name my-app --environment-name my-app-env --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2 v3.3.6 running Python 3.8"
```

## Best Practices
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Enable enhanced health reporting.

## Common Pitfalls
- Not versioning application deployments.
- Ignoring environment health warnings.

> **Joke:** Why did Elastic Beanstalk get so popular? It always knew how to grow on you!
