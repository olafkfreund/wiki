# Real life examples

1. Azure Security Center: Azure Security Center is a cloud-native security management tool that provides visibility into the security state of Azure resources. It provides security recommendations, vulnerability assessments, and threat protection for Azure resources. Here's an example of using PowerShell to enable Azure Security Center:

```powershell
Set-AzSecurityCenterSubscription -SubscriptionId <Subscription ID> -ResourceGroup <Resource Group Name> -Enabled $true
```plaintext

2. Azure Active Directory: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management tool that provides authentication and authorization for Azure resources. It allows organizations to manage user identities, control access to Azure resources, and enforce security policies. Here's an example of using the Azure AD PowerShell module to create a new user:

```powershell
New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $true -DisplayName "John Doe" -UserPrincipalName "john.doe@contoso.com" -Password "P@ssw0rd"
```plaintext

3. Azure Key Vault: Azure Key Vault is a cloud-based service that provides key management and cryptographic operations for Azure resources. It allows organizations to securely store and manage cryptographic keys, certificates, and secrets. Here's an example of using PowerShell to create a new key vault:

```powershell
New-AzKeyVault -VaultName <Vault Name> -ResourceGroupName <Resource Group Name> -Location <Location>
```plaintext

4. Azure Policy: Azure Policy is a cloud-based service that provides governance and compliance for Azure resources. It allows organizations to enforce compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Here's an example of using Azure Policy to enforce a policy that requires multi-factor authentication for users:

```json
New-AzPolicyDefinition -Name "Require MFA for Users" -Description "Requires multi-factor authentication for all users" -Policy '{
  "if": {
    "allOf": [
      {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments"
      },
      {
        "field": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/enforcementMode",
        "equals": "Default"
      }
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny",
    "details": {
      "type": "Microsoft.MultiFactorAuthentication/userstates",
      "exists": "false"
    }
  }
}'
```plaintext

These are just a few examples of Azure SecOps practices and tools that can be used to enhance the security of Azure resources. By leveraging these tools and practices, organizations can ensure the security and compliance of their Azure resources, reducing the risk of security breaches and other security threats.
