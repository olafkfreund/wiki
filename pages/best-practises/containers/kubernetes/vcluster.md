# VCluster: Virtual Kubernetes Clusters for DevOps

VCluster (Virtual Cluster) enables you to run multiple isolated Kubernetes clusters (vclusters) within a single host cluster. This is ideal for multi-tenant, development, testing, and regional deployments on AKS, EKS, GKE, or on-prem clusters.

---

## Real-Life Use Cases
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS:** Isolate customer workloads in separate vclusters for security and compliance.
- **Dev/Test Environments:** Spin up ephemeral vclusters for feature branches, CI/CD, or integration testing without impacting production.
- **Regional Deployments:** Deploy vclusters per region to meet data residency or regulatory requirements.
- **Platform Engineering:** Empower teams to manage their own vclusters with full Kubernetes API access, while centralizing infrastructure management.

## Step-by-Step: Deploying a vcluster
1. **Install vcluster CLI:**
   ```sh
   curl -sSL https://vcluster.com/download | bash
   # or use Homebrew
   brew install vcluster
   ```
2. **Create a vcluster in a namespace:**
   ```sh
   kubectl create namespace dev-team
   vcluster create dev-vcluster -n dev-team
   ```
3. **Connect to the vcluster:**
   ```sh
   vcluster connect dev-vcluster -n dev-team
   # This updates your kubeconfig to point to the vcluster
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
4. **Deploy workloads in the vcluster:**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml
   ```
5. **List and manage vclusters:**
   ```sh
   vcluster list
   vcluster delete dev-vcluster -n dev-team
   ```

## Best Practices
- Use separate namespaces for each vcluster to ensure isolation.
- Automate vcluster lifecycle (creation, deletion) in CI/CD pipelines for ephemeral environments.
- Monitor resource usage in the host cluster to avoid noisy neighbor issues.
- Use RBAC and network policies to restrict access between vclusters.
- Store vcluster configuration and manifests in Git for GitOps workflows.

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Overcommitting host cluster resources (CPU, memory) can impact all vclusters.
- Not cleaning up unused vclusters leads to resource waste.
- Assuming vcluster isolation is equivalent to physical cluster isolation (some host-level risks remain).
- Manual changes outside of Git in GitOps-managed environments.
