# Kubeaudit

`kubeaudit` is a command-line tool that audits Kubernetes configurations for security issues. It can be used to detect security vulnerabilities in Kubernetes configurations and ensure that best practices are followed when deploying applications to Kubernetes. In this wiki page, we will provide an introduction to `kubeaudit` and how it can be used in real-life Azure deployment pipelines.

### Introduction to Kubeaudit

`kubeaudit` is a tool that audits Kubernetes configurations for security issues. It checks that the configurations are following best practices and are not vulnerable to security threats. `kubeaudit` is useful for catching security vulnerabilities early in the development cycle and ensuring that Kubernetes configurations are secure before deployment.

`kubeaudit` checks for a variety of security issues in Kubernetes configurations, including:

* Privileged containers
* Host namespaces
* Running as root
* Insecure capabilities
* Insecure volume mounts
* Insecure image registries
* Unused secrets and configmaps

### Using Kubeaudit in Real-Life Azure Deployment Pipelines

`kubeaudit` can be used in Azure deployment pipelines to audit Kubernetes configurations for security issues. By using `kubeaudit` in your deployment pipeline, you can ensure that your Kubernetes configurations are secure and not vulnerable to security threats.

Here are some examples of how to use `kubeaudit` in real-life Azure deployment pipelines:

#### Example 1: Auditing Kubernetes Configurations in a CI/CD Pipeline

Suppose you have a CI/CD pipeline that deploys Kubernetes configurations to a production environment. You can use `kubeaudit` to audit the configurations before deployment:

```yaml
- name: Audit Kubernetes configurations
  run: |
    curl -sL https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases/latest/download/kubeaudit-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
    ./kubeaudit audit deployment.yaml
```plaintext

This command downloads the latest version of `kubeaudit`, audits the `deployment.yaml` file for security issues, and fails the build if any security issues are found.

#### Example 2: Auditing Kubernetes Configurations Locally

Suppose you are developing a Kubernetes configuration locally and want to audit it for security issues before deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster. You can use `kubeaudit` to audit the configuration locally:

```bash
kubeaudit audit deployment.yaml
```plaintext

This command audits the `deployment.yaml` file for security issues and prints any security issues found to the console.

#### Example 3: Ignoring Specific Rules

Suppose you have a Kubernetes configuration that violates a specific security rule, but you want to ignore that rule. You can use `kubeaudit` to ignore specific rules:

```yaml
- name: Audit Kubernetes configurations
  run: |
    curl -sL https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases/latest/download/kubeaudit-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
    ./kubeaudit audit --ignore-container-read-only-root-filesystem deployment.yaml
```plaintext

This command audits the `deployment.yaml` file for security issues but ignores the `--ignore-container-read-only-root-filesystem` rule.

### Conclusion

`kubeaudit` is a powerful tool that can be used to audit Kubernetes configurations for security issues. It is particularly useful in Azure deployment pipelines where it can ensure that Kubernetes configurations are secure before they are deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. By using `kubeaudit` in your deployment pipeline, you can ensure that your Kubernetes configurations are secure and not vulnerable to security threats.
