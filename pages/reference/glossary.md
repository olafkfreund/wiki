## D

**Docker**
: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

**DevOps**
: A set of practices combining software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten development cycles and provide continuous delivery.

**DevSecOps**
: Integration of security practices within DevOps processes.

## E

**Edge Computing**
: Distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed.

**Elasticity**
: The ability to automatically scale computing resources up or down based on demand.

## F

**Failover**
: Switching to a redundant system upon the failure of the primary system.

**Feature Flag**
: A software development technique that turns functionality on/off without deploying new code.

**FinOps**
: Cloud financial operations combining finance, technology, and business practices to manage and optimize cloud costs.

**Flux**
: A GitOps tool for Kubernetes that ensures clusters are configured as specified in Git.

## G

**Git**
: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.

**GitOps**
: A way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications using Git as the single source of truth.

## H

**HAProxy**
: An open-source load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications.

**Helm**
: A package manager for Kubernetes that helps manage Kubernetes applications.

## I

**IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**
: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.

**Immutable Infrastructure**
: Infrastructure that is never modified after deployment; changes require new deployments.

## K

**Kubernetes**
: An open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Kustomize**
: A Kubernetes native configuration management tool.

## L

**Load Balancer**
: A device or service that distributes network traffic across multiple servers.

**LLMOps**
: Machine Learning Operations specifically focused on deploying and managing Large Language Models in production.

**Logging**
: The practice of recording events, processes, and outputs in a system.

## M

**Microservices**
: An architectural style structuring an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

**Monitoring**
: The collection and analysis of data about system performance and behavior.

## O

**Observability**
: The ability to understand a system's internal state from its external outputs.

**OpenShift**
: Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes platform.

**OpenTelemetry**
: Open-source observability framework for cloud-native software, combining metrics, traces, and logs.

## P

**Pipeline**
: An automated sequence of processes for delivering software from development to production.

**Platform Engineering**
: The discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations.

**Pod**
: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that can contain one or more containers.

## R

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
: A method of regulating access to resources based on roles of individual users.

**Rolling Update**
: A deployment strategy that gradually replaces instances of the previous version with new versions.

## S

**SLA (Service Level Agreement)**
: A commitment between a service provider and client about aspects of the service like performance and availability.

**SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)**
: A discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems.

**SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts)**
: Security framework for ensuring software supply chain integrity.

**Service Mesh**
: Infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications between microservices.

## T

**Terraform**
: An open-source Infrastructure as Code software tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

**Toil**
: Manual, repetitive, and automatable work that scales linearly as a system grows.

## V

**VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
: An isolated section of a cloud where you can launch resources in a defined virtual network.

**Version Control**
: A system that records changes to files over time, enabling collaboration and rollback capabilities.

## W
