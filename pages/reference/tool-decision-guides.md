## Decision Trees

### Infrastructure as Code: Terraform vs. Pulumi

graph TD
    A[Do you want to use general-purpose programming languages?] -->|Yes| B[Pulumi]
    A -->|No| C[Terraform]
    B --> D{Multi-cloud support needed?}
    C --> D
    D -->|Yes| E[Both are suitable]
    D -->|No| F[Choose based on team skills]
```

**Quick Reference Table**

| Criteria                | Terraform        | Pulumi           |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Language                | HCL              | Python, TS, Go   |
| Ecosystem               | Mature           | Growing          |
| Learning Curve          | Medium           | Medium-High      |
| Multi-cloud             | Yes              | Yes              |
| Policy as Code          | Sentinel         | Open Policy Agent |

## Migration Guides

### Jenkins to GitHub Actions

**Step-by-Step Migration:**

1. **Inventory Jenkins Jobs:**  
   List all jobs, triggers, and plugins in use.
2. **Map Plugins to Actions:**  
   Find equivalent GitHub Actions or Marketplace actions.
3. **Convert Pipelines:**  
   - Jenkinsfile â†’ `.github/workflows/*.yml`
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     name: CI
     on: [push]
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           - name: Run tests
             run: ./gradlew test
     ```
4. **Secrets & Credentials:**  
   Move credentials to GitHub Secrets.
5. **Test & Validate:**  
   Run workflows, compare outputs, and iterate.
6. **Decommission Jenkins:**  
   After successful migration and validation.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Missing plugin equivalents
- Environment differences (self-hosted vs. GitHub runners)
- Secret management changes
