# Bash Shortcuts Every Linux User Needs to Know

### Linux bash shortcut – tab key

The first shortcut we will discuss is the Tab key. The Tab key is used for one main purpose in bash: completion.

Completion is a feature that allows you to type in the first few letters of a command, filename, or directory name and then hit the Tab key to automatically complete the rest. This can be a huge time saver, especially when you are working with long filenames or complex directory structures.

When you are typing a command, you can hit the Tab key to automatically complete the command or show a list of commands that start with the letters you have typed so far. This can be very useful when you forget the exact name of a command or when you want to see a list of all the available commands that start with a certain letter.
