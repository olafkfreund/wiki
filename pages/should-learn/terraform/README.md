# Terraform

Terraform is a tool that allows you to create and manage infrastructure as code. You can use Terraform to define the resources you need for your application, such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and more, across different cloud platforms and services.&#x20;

Terraform uses a declarative language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to describe the desired state of your infrastructure.&#x20;

Terraform then compares the current state of your infrastructure with the desired state and makes the necessary changes to achieve it. Terraform can also help you manage dependencies, versioning, and reusability of your infrastructure code.
