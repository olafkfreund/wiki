# Service Mesh (2025)

A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that manages service-to-service communication in a microservices architecture. It provides traffic management, security, observability, and reliability features without requiring changes to application code.

---

## Why Use a Service Mesh?

- **Traffic Management:** Fine-grained control over routing, retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking
- **Security:** mTLS encryption, service authentication, and policy enforcement
- **Observability:** Distributed tracing, metrics, and logging for all service traffic
- **Reliability:** Automatic retries, failover, and health checks
- **Zero-Trust Networking:** Enforce least-privilege and secure-by-default communication

---

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Enhanced security (mTLS, RBAC) | Added complexity and resource overhead |
| Consistent traffic policies | Steep learning curve for teams |
| Deep observability and tracing | May impact latency/performance |
| Platform-agnostic (multi-cloud) | Debugging can be harder |
| Enables progressive delivery (canary, blue/green) | |

## Popular Service Mesh Providers

- **Istio** (open source, works on any Kubernetes, supported by GKE, AKS, EKS)
- **Linkerd** (lightweight, easy to install, CNCF project)
- **Consul Connect** (HashiCorp, integrates with VMs and Kubernetes)
- **AWS App Mesh** (managed for EKS, ECS, EC2)
- **Azure Service Mesh** (preview, managed for AKS)
- **Anthos Service Mesh** (GCP, managed Istio)

---

## Example: Installing Istio on Kubernetes (Cloud-Agnostic)

```bash
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
cd istio-*
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

- For AKS: Use Azure CLI to create the cluster, then follow the above steps
- For EKS: Use AWS CLI and eksctl to create the cluster, then follow the above steps
- For GKE: Use gcloud to create the cluster, then follow the above steps

---

## Example: Deploying a Sample App with Istio

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
```

Access the app via Istio ingress gateway (see Istio docs for cloud-specific instructions).

---

## Example: Enabling mTLS for All Services

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

## Best Practices (2025)

- Start with a minimal mesh (e.g., Linkerd or Istio demo profile) and scale up
- Use GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux) to manage mesh configuration and CRDs
- Monitor mesh health with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger
- Use LLMs (Copilot, Claude) to generate and review mesh policies and manifests
- Document mesh usage and onboarding for your team

## Common Pitfalls

- Overcomplicating the mesh with too many features at once
- Not monitoring mesh resource usage (can impact cluster performance)
- Failing to secure the mesh dashboard and control plane
- Manual changes outside Git (causes drift in GitOps setups)
