Agile is a term that describes approaches to software development that emphasize incremental delivery, team collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning. The term _Agile_ was coined in 2001 in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). The manifesto set out to establish principles to guide a better approach to software development. At its core, the manifesto declares four value statements that represent the foundation of the Agile movement. As written, the manifesto states:

We have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.

The manifesto doesn't imply that the items on the right side of these statements aren't important or needed. Rather, items on the left are simply more valued.
