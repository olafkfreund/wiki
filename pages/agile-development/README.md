# Agile Development

![Diagram that shows various aspects of Agile feeding into each other, such as collaboration, development, and automated version control and deployment.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/_img/whatisagile_600x300.png)

Agile is a set of principles and practices for software development that emphasize incremental delivery, team collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning. The term _Agile_ was coined in 2001 in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), which established four core values:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
- **Responding to change over following a plan**

> The manifesto doesn't imply that the items on the right are unimportant, but that the items on the left are more highly valued.

## Agile in 2025: Latest Practices

- **DevOps Integration:** Agile and DevOps are now tightly coupled. Teams use CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines) to automate testing, deployment, and feedback loops.
- **Cloud-Native Delivery:** Agile teams leverage cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for rapid provisioning, scaling, and experimentation.
- **AI & LLMs in Agile:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot and Claude are used for code generation, documentation, and backlog grooming.
- **Remote & Hybrid Collaboration:** Tools like Azure DevOps, Jira, and Slack support distributed Agile teams with real-time boards, async standups, and automated notifications.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Automated monitoring, feature flags, and A/B testing enable rapid learning and adaptation.

## Real-Life Example: Agile Sprint with DevOps

1. **Backlog Refinement:**
   - Product Owner and team use Azure Boards to prioritize user stories.
2. **Sprint Planning:**
   - Engineers estimate tasks and define acceptance criteria.
3. **Development:**
   - Code is committed to GitHub; Copilot suggests code and tests.
   - CI pipeline runs tests and builds Docker images.
4. **Deployment:**
   - Azure Pipelines deploys to a Kubernetes cluster (AKS).
5. **Review & Retrospective:**
   - Team reviews metrics (e.g., deployment frequency, lead time) and discusses improvements.

## Best Practices (2025)

- Keep feedback loops shortâ€”automate testing and deployment.
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep) for reproducible environments.
- Integrate LLMs for documentation, code review, and backlog management.
- Foster psychological safety for open communication and experimentation.
- Measure outcomes (not just outputs): focus on customer value and business impact.

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-reliance on tools without team collaboration.
- Neglecting technical debt and refactoring.
- Failing to adapt processes as the team or product evolves.
