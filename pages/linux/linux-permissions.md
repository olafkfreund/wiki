# Linux Permissions

### What are Linux Permissions? <a href="#59f4" id="59f4"></a>

Linux permissions are a fundamental aspect of the Linux operating system that governs access to files and directories. They determine who can read, write, and execute files, as well as who has the authority to change permissions or ownership of these resources.

The three permission categories used by Linux are user, group, and other, each of which has its own set of permissions.

1. User Permissions: These permissions specify the owner of the file or directory’s access privileges. These are the top three user permissions:\
   Read (r): This command enables the user to browse a directory’s contents or view a file’s contents.\
   Write (w): Allows the user to add, delete, or change files. It also allows the user to add or remove files from a directory.\
   Execute (x): Allows the user to run a program from a file.
2. Group Permissions: Group permissions regulate access for people who are a part of a certain group. A group is a collection of users who have similar access rights. The read, write, and execute permissions for a group are identical to those for an individual user.
3. Other Permissions: Users who are neither the file’s owner nor a member of the group are covered by other permissions. These permissions also include read, write, and execute permissions.
