### Designing a zero-trust architecture <a href="#_idparadest-165" id="_idparadest-165"></a>

_Company BigMoney has concerns across its Azure, on-premises, and SaaS applications’ architecture. They have come to you for assistance in addressing their security concerns. They want you to provide suggestions on how they can use the security capabilities within Azure, Azure AD, and Microsoft 365 to enforce zero-trust methodologies across the company’s technology infrastructure._

The possible responses for the company’s areas of concern and requirements for enforcing Zero-trust include the following:

* Utilization of strong modern authentication techniques for all users, including cloud-native and on-premises directory users:
  * The cybersecurity architect should develop a plan to migrate users to Azure AD as a cloud-native identity provider. For users to remain on Windows AD, you can utilize Azure AD Connect with either password hash or pass-through synchronization with password write-back. This will allow modern authentication to new applications and the ability to utilize Azure AD MFA and Conditional Access policies.
  * Applications that support modern authentication can be registered in Azure AD to use cloud-native identities for authentication and authorization.
* Guest users should only be allowed to access resources that are assigned to them, and they should be regularly reviewed:
  * This can be accomplished utilizing Entitlement Management within Microsoft Entra Identity Governance
  * Regular access reviews can be created with Company ABC project managers or supervisors as the reviewers
* Administrative users should have **Just-in-Time** (**JIT**) access to privileged resources and all access should be justified and audited:
  * Microsoft Entra Identity Governance with **Privileged Identity Management** (**PIM**) provides JIT access. All enabled privileged access requires a justification and is audited.
  * Migrating users to Azure AD as a cloud-native identity provider will allow this governance to be used across all users within the company.
* When accessing applications that contain sensitive information, users should be required to verify their identity:
  * Planning, developing, and using Conditional Access policies to protect sensitive business applications should be done here. Applications and additional verification requirements for compliant devices and user-required MFA can be used for access and authorization.
* All user identities should be protected from common attacks:
  * Azure AD Identity Protection will monitor user and sign-in risks. The risks include common attack vectors such as brute-force identity attacks.
  * Azure AD Password protection can be used to protect against brute-force attacks by setting parameters for login frequency to block them. Password strength can be enforced by creating a dictionary of blocked passwords.
* Users that are accessing company resources from potentially dangerous locations should be forced to re-authenticate:
  * Additional Conditional Access policies can be created that identify trusted and untrusted locations that can force changes in the password and/or MFA verification. Untrusted locations can also be blocked from allowing users to authenticate.
* Devices should be verified with proper security patches before accessing company resources:
  * Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can be used to decrease the attack surface on Windows 10 and 11 devices
  * All devices that are accessing company resources should be managed with Microsoft Intune MDM or MAM
  * Conditional Access policies can be created to verify that devices follow Microsoft Intune policies before accessing applications
* Users should be analyzed for anomalous behavior and potential threats to identities:
  * Azure AD Identity Protection will monitor user and sign-in risks. This solution will monitor for potential threats and anomalous user behavior.
  * Creating a user risk policy can protect users, identify anomalies, and protect against unauthorized access from risky users.
* Network resources with sensitive information should not be accessible through publicly available connections:
  * Network infrastructure and resources should be designed with VNet segmentation. Resources containing sensitive information should be on their own dedicated VNet. Access through the network should be protected more securely than VNet peering. Network and Application Security Groups should have rules for how traffic goes between VNet segments and subnets to the private VNets.
  * Data on applications should also be identified, classified, and protected by using sensitivity labels. Sensitivity labels should be configured within DLP policies to decrease the potential for over-sharing of data by users.
  * Data that is being accessed across networks, both private and public, can be protected with private endpoint connections or service endpoints within **Network Security Groups** (**NSGs**).
* All activity and event data should be logged and can be reviewed:
  * Azure Monitor should be turned on for all Azure resources
  * Azure Arc can extend the monitoring to non-Azure resources
  * Microsoft 365 monitors and logs SaaS activity
  * Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel can be used to connect all data sources and provide a single location for monitoring and reviewing events and activities for malicious activity
* Reports can be generated for executive reviews and incident handling:
  * Taking these steps when monitoring activities and events allows the creation of reports for review. This information can also be used in custom dashboards, workbooks, and Power BI.

### Designing for regulatory compliance <a href="#_idparadest-166" id="_idparadest-166"></a>

_Company BigMoney has concerns across its Azure, on-premises, and SaaS applications architecture. They have come to you for assistance in addressing their regulatory and privacy concerns. They want you to provide suggestions on how they can use the standards and regulatory compliance and privacy capabilities within Microsoft and Azure to govern data residency and data privacy across the company’s technology infrastructure._

The possible responses for the company’s areas of concern and requirements include the following:

* The company has recently begun to handle credit card transactions and they need to audit compliance with PCI-DSS:
  * In the Microsoft 365 Purview compliance portal, the PCI-DSS assessment template can be run in the Compliance Score area to determine SaaS and Azure SQL Database compliance with PCI-DSS.
  * In Azure, Microsoft Defender for Cloud can be used when turning on the Defender Plans. The PCI-DSS policy initiative can be enabled from within the Standards and Compliance menu. Resources will be assessed and audited for compliance and remediation actions will be provided as guidance.
* The company has expanded outside of the UK and is now doing business in Germany. They need to make sure that they are adhering to the standards for data residency within Germany:
  * Azure Policy has built-in initiatives that can be enabled for various geographically specific regulatory requirements.
  * As a cybersecurity architect, you should be familiar with the residency requirements in certain countries. Germany is particularly stringent in their requirements, and the first recommendation that you should have is to create a segmented Azure Resource Group for the German region for proper governance.
* The company is concerned that data is not properly classified, and sensitive data may be exposed. They need a recommendation to identify any sensitive data and classify it:
  * Microsoft Purview Compliance can be used for the identification and classification of sensitive data within Microsoft 365, Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, and multi-cloud storage resources, such as AWS S3
  * Sensitive data that is identified can be governed by sensitivity labels and policies to avoid the exposure of this data
  * Data Loss Prevention policies can be used to avoid oversharing data
* With PCI-DSS, they need to make sure that encryption keys are not being managed by the individual Azure services, such as Azure Storage and SQL Database. They need a recommendation to better manage keys:
  * Azure Key Vault provides the separation of duties and allows the company to manage the keys. They need additional configuration to change the encryption in Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database from Microsoft-managed to customer-managed keys.
* The company needs to audit current resources for PCI-DSS compliance and verify that all virtual machines are encrypted:
  * Azure Policy can be enabled to address the need to audit resources for Azure Disk Encryption to be enabled on virtual machines that are monitored with Azure Monitor or Azure Arc
  * Additional improvement recommendations and auditing for compliance can be accessed within Microsoft Defender for Cloud
* Users that are accessing intranet applications must not be allowed to use a public internet connection. How would you recommend securing this communication?
  * Point-to-site VPN connections through a VPN Gateway should be designed to secure the communication channels of users accessing applications. Private endpoints can be created between applications and data within storage accounts and databases.
