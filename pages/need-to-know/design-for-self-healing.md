# Design for Self-Healing Applications

Designing for self-healing ensures your cloud-native applications (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes) can detect, respond to, and recover from failures automatically. This approach increases reliability, reduces manual intervention, and supports high availability.

---

## Key Principles
1. **Detect Failures**: Use monitoring, health checks, and alerts.
2. **Respond Gracefully**: Automate recovery actions (restart, failover, scale).
3. **Log & Monitor**: Capture metrics and logs for operational insight.

## Step-by-Step: Implementing Self-Healing

### 1. Health Checks & Monitoring
- Use readiness and liveness probes in Kubernetes:
  ```yaml
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5
  ```
- Enable cloud-native monitoring (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Operations Suite).
- Set up alerts for critical metrics (CPU, memory, error rates).

### 2. Automated Recovery
- **Kubernetes:**
  - Pods are automatically restarted on failure.
  - Use Deployments/StatefulSets for self-healing workloads.
- **Cloud VMs:**
  - Use auto-healing groups (AWS Auto Scaling, Azure VMSS, GCP Instance Groups).
- **Serverless:**
  - Functions are retried automatically on failure (configurable in AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions).

### 3. Resiliency Patterns
- **Retry Logic:**
  - Implement exponential backoff for transient errors.
  - Example (Python):
    ```python
    import time
    for i in range(5):
        try:
            # call remote service
            break
        except Exception:
            time.sleep(2 ** i)
    ```
- **Circuit Breaker:**
  - Use libraries like Polly (.NET), Resilience4j (Java), or Hystrix (legacy) to prevent cascading failures.
- **Bulkhead:**
  - Isolate resources to prevent one failure from impacting the whole system.
- **Queue-Based Load Leveling:**
  - Use message queues (SQS, Azure Service Bus, Pub/Sub) to buffer spikes.

### 4. Failover & Redundancy
- Deploy across multiple zones/regions.
- Use managed databases with automatic failover (RDS, Cosmos DB, Cloud SQL).
- For stateless services, use load balancers (ALB, Azure Load Balancer, GCP Load Balancer).

### 5. Chaos Engineering & Fault Injection
- Test failure scenarios using tools like:
  - [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/) (Kubernetes)
  - [AWS Fault Injection Simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/)
  - [Azure Chaos Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/)
- Example: Simulate pod failure in Kubernetes:
  ```sh
  kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
  ```

## Real-Life Example: Self-Healing Web App on Kubernetes
1. Deploy app with liveness/readiness probes.
2. Set up HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) to scale on CPU/memory.
3. Use Prometheus + Alertmanager for monitoring and alerting.
4. Automate rollbacks with ArgoCD/Flux if health checks fail after deployment.

---

## Best Practices
- Always automate detection and recoveryâ€”avoid manual intervention.
- Store all configuration as code (GitOps).
- Regularly test failure scenarios in lower environments.
- Document recovery procedures and automate them where possible.
- Use LLMs (Copilot, Claude) to generate runbooks or analyze logs for root cause.

## Common Pitfalls
- Relying only on manual monitoring or intervention.
- Not testing failure and recovery paths.
- Ignoring resource limits, leading to OOMKilled pods.
- Failing to monitor both application and infrastructure layers.
