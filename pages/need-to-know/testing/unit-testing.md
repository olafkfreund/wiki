# Unit testing

Unit testing is a critical practice for Platform Engineers, who are responsible for designing and maintaining the infrastructure and tools that enable software development teams to build and deploy applications. Unit testing is a software testing technique that involves testing individual units, or components, of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system.

Unit tests help to ensure that each individual component of an application is functioning correctly and that any changes or updates made to the code do not break existing functionality. This is especially important for Platform Engineers, who are often dealing with complex and interconnected systems.

By implementing unit tests, Platform Engineers can catch errors and bugs early in the development process before they become more costly and time-consuming to fix. Unit tests also help to ensure that code changes are implemented correctly and do not have unintended consequences.

In addition to improving the quality and reliability of the code, unit tests can also help to increase the speed and efficiency of the development process. By catching errors early, developers can avoid spending time and resources on debugging and troubleshooting.

Overall, unit testing is an essential practice for Platform Engineers who want to ensure that their infrastructure and tools are reliable, efficient, and effective. By incorporating unit testing into their development processes, Platform Engineers can improve the quality and reliability of their systems and help to ensure the success of their organization's software development efforts.
