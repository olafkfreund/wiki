# The 12 Factor App

The 12 Factor App is a methodology for building modern, cloud-native applications that are scalable, portable, and maintainable. The 12 factors are a set of best practices that promote agility, flexibility, and reliability in application development, deployment, and operation.

The twelve factors are:

1. **Codebase** - One codebase per application, version-controlled in a single repository.
2. **Dependencies** - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
3. Configuration - Store configuration in the environment, not in code.
4. **Backing services** - Treat backing services (e.g. databases, caches, message brokers) as attached resources.
5. **Build, release, run** - Strictly separate build, release, and run stages.
6. **Processes** - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.
7. **Port binding** - Export services via port binding.
8. **Concurrency** - Scale out via the process model.
9. **Disposability** - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
10. **Dev/prod parity** - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.
11. **Logs** - Treat logs as event streams.
12. **Admin processes** - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.

Adopting the 12 Factor App methodology can bring a number of benefits to application development and deployment, including:

* **Better scalability and availability**: 12 Factor Apps can be easily scaled horizontally, making them more resilient to traffic spikes and ensuring high availability.
* **Improved portability**: By keeping the application stateless and externalizing configuration and services, 12 Factor Apps can be easily deployed to different environments and platforms.
* **Faster development and deployment cycles**: By strictly separating build, release, and run stages, and by using automation tools, 12 Factor Apps can be developed and deployed more quickly and with fewer errors.
* **Enhanced maintainability**: By following best practices for code organization, dependency management, and process management, 12 Factor Apps are easier to maintain over time.

Overall, the 12 Factor App methodology provides a set of guidelines for building modern, cloud-native applications that are scalable, portable, and maintainable, and that can be easily deployed and operated in a variety of environments.
