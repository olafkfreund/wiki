# Guide to Blue-Green, Canary, and Rolling Deployments

### Blue-Green Deployment <a href="#78bf" id="78bf"></a>

Blue-green deployment is a deployment strategy that involves maintaining two identical production environments, one known as the blue environment and the other known as the green environment. _**The active environment, which is serving live traffic, is referred to as blue, while the inactive environment is referred to as green.**_ When itâ€™s time to deploy a new release, the new version is first deployed to the green environment. Once the new version is tested and validated in the green environment, _**the live traffic is redirected from the blue environment to the green environment, making the green environment the new active environment.**_

### Pros: <a href="#bbd5" id="bbd5"></a>

* Blue-green deployment allows for minimal downtime during deployment because the switchover from one environment to the other is seamless and happens quickly.
* It also makes it easy to roll back to the previous version in the event of a failure, as the previous version is still available in the blue environment.

### Cons: <a href="#d8f4" id="d8f4"></a>

* Blue-green deployment requires a significant number of resources, as two identical production environments must be maintained.
* It can also be more complex to set up and manage than other deployment strategies, as two environments must be kept in sync.

### Canary Deployment <a href="#0b45" id="0b45"></a>

Canary deployment is a deployment strategy that involves gradually rolling out a new version of software to a small subset of users before deploying it to the entire user base. _**The idea behind this approach is to test the new version in a real-world setting and catch any issues before they affect the entire user base.**_

### Pros: <a href="#7a4c" id="7a4c"></a>

* Canary deployment allows for a low-risk release of a new version, as it is only deployed to a small subset of users at first.
* It also allows for real-world testing of the new version, which can help catch any issues before they affect the entire user base.
* This approach can be especially useful for catching performance or scalability issues.

### Cons: <a href="#e786" id="e786"></a>

* Canary deployment can be complex to set up and manage, as it requires gradually rolling out the new version to different groups of users.
* It may also result in a poor user experience, as some users may experience the new version while others do not, which can be confusing.

### Rolling Deployment <a href="#ba70" id="ba70"></a>

Rolling deployment is a deployment strategy that involves gradually deploying a new version of software to a subset of servers, one server at a time. The new version is first deployed to a small subset of servers, and then the process is repeated for the next subset of servers until the entire production environment has been updated.

### Pros: <a href="#b7b5" id="b7b5"></a>

* Rolling deployment allows for a low-risk release of a new version, _as it is deployed gradually to a small subset of servers at a time._
* It also allows for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting, as the new version can be tested on a small subset of servers before being deployed to the entire production environment.
* _This approach is especially useful for large-scale deployments_, as it reduces the risk of a deployment failure affecting the entire production environment.

### Cons: <a href="#bef8" id="bef8"></a>

* Rolling deployment can be complex to set up and manage, as it requires coordinating the deployment of the new version to different subsets of servers.
* It may also result in longer deployment times, as the new version must be deployed to each subset of servers one at a time.
* In some cases, it can also lead to uneven distribution of load, as some servers may have the new version while others do not, which can result in performance issues.
