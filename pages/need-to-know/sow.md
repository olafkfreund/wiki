# SOW

A Statement of Work (SOW) is a document that outlines the scope of work, deliverables, timelines, and dependencies of a project. For a Platform Engineer, an SOW is a critical document that provides a clear understanding of what is expected of them in terms of designing, building, and maintaining the technology platform.

Here are some key elements that should be included in an SOW for a Platform Engineer:

1. Scope of Work: This section should outline the specific responsibilities and tasks of the Platform Engineer. For example, this may include designing and implementing new features, maintaining existing systems, and resolving technical issues.
2. Deliverables: This section should define the expected outcomes of the project, including any software, documentation, or other artifacts that the Platform Engineer is expected to produce.
3. Timelines: This section should include specific deadlines for each task or deliverable, as well as overall project timelines. This helps to ensure that the project stays on track and that stakeholders are aware of expected timelines.
4. Dependencies: This section should outline any dependencies that the project has on other teams, systems, or technologies. This helps to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of what is required to complete the project successfully.
5. Acceptance Criteria: This section should include specific criteria that must be met for the project to be considered complete. This helps to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on what constitutes a successful project outcome.

Overall, an SOW for a Platform Engineer is a critical document that provides a clear understanding of what is expected of the Platform Engineer in terms of delivering a successful technology platform. By outlining the scope of work, deliverables, timelines, dependencies, and acceptance criteria, an SOW helps to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on the project goals and expectations.
